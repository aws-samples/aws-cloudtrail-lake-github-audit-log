# GitHub Audit Log to CloudTrail Lake Module

This module can be used to integrate GitHub Audit Log to AWS CloudTrail Lake. This solution uses GitHub Audit Log streaming to S3 as the data source, transform and send the events to CloudTrail Lake data store. Refer to the [solution readme](../../README.md) for more details.

## Usage 

You must complete the [general prerequisites](../../README.md#general-prerequisites) as referenced in the solution README before deploying this module. 

The example below will deploy the module with a new S3 bucket for GitHub audit log. 

```
module "github-cloudtrail-auditlog" {
  source                          = "../../"
  create_github_auditlog_s3bucket = true
  github_auditlog_s3bucket        = "my_new_github_auditlog_s3bucket" # bucket name must be unique
  cloudtrail_lake_channel_arn     = "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:204034886740:channel/0dec681b-ff12-499a-a7ba-7866086b2a86" # complete the prerequisite to get channel ARN
}
```

After the module is deployed, use the module output S3 bucket name to configure GitHub audit log. Check the guide [Setting up streaming to Amazon S3](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-amazon-s3).
